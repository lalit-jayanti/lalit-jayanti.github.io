I am a [MSR](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/master-of-science-robotics/) at the [Robotics Institute, CMU](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/). I have worked as a research intern at the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/), focusing on multi-agent reinforcement learning. I have also been a part of [Centre For Innovation \| IIT Madras](https://cfi.iitm.ac.in/), where I contributed to developing autonomous vehicles and participated in international robotics competitions, during my undergraduate studies at [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/).

I am interested in a range of topics in robotics and artificial intelligence, such as path planning, control of multi-agent systems and data-driven reinforcement learning. My goal is to develop safe, robust, and scalable autonomous systems, including robotic assistants such as mobile manipulators and autonomous vehicles.
