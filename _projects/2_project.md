I adapted, synthesized, and analyzed Jansen's Linkage for application as a robotic leg, as a part of a team. 

- We synthesized the mechanism for our application (design phase).
- Analytically verified the mechanism's performance against design criteria (analysis phase). 
- Successfully prototyped it using 3D printing (implementation phase).

In this project, I was responsible for:
- Dimension Synthesis: Applied Burmester theory and dyad synthesis techniques to determine optimal link lengths.
- Kinematic Analysis: Verified the design criteria through analytical kinematic analysis, and implemented the formulation programmatically.
- Dynamic Analysis: Used the Newton-Euler method to derive force equations and determine the torque profile at the crank for varying force profiles, enabling the sizing of an appropriate motor.
- This work strengthened my expertise in mechanism synthesis, kinematic and dynamic analysis, as well as analytical modeling, programming and visualization.
